# When set to true, one sign protects all connected nearby blocks of the same

# All protections (except doors) that consist not only of the block listed here,
# but also of a supporting block. This is normally the block directly below.
# For example, for fence gates both the gate and the block below are protected,
# and signs can be attached to both.
# Note that for some blocks (like trapdoors, but also levers if you would add
# them here) the supporting block is not the block below, but the block it is
# attached on.

# The default amount of seconds a door stays open before closing automatically.
# Players can override this value by putting a [Timer:X] tag on the sign, where
# X is a number from 0 to 9.
# When using 0 or a negative value, the door will never close automatically.
# When the door was opened using redstone, the door will never close
# automatically too.
defaultDoorOpenSeconds: 0

# The amount of days the owner of a chest can be absent before the chest is
# unlocked. When zero or negative chests never expire.
#
# This setting will only work for online mode servers (or offline mode servers
# behind an online mode Bungee proxy). The reason is as follows. The last login time
# is stored in the player file. To access this player file, you nowadays need the UUID
# of the player. In offline mode, the UUID depends on the case-correct username. In
# other words: if a player (intentionally or not) puts the wrong cases on the sign
# (like notch instead of Notch), the chest protection would never expire. This behaviour is
# undesired, so chest expiration has been disabled altogether in offline mode.
autoExpireDays: 0

# Aside from players breaking protections, this plugin also prevents other things
# (creepers and TNT for example) from breaking protections. You can add things here
# if you want those things to destroy protections.
# For example,  allowDestroyBy: [CREEPER, TNT]  allows creepers and TNT to destroy
# protections.
#
# These are the values you can use, along with how they can destroy protections.
# BLOCK_EXPLOSION - some blocks like beds can destroy protections by exploding
#                  Note: TNT is an entity when exploding, so it's not affected by this value
# CREEPER - creepers can destroy protections by exploding
# ENDERMAN - endermans can destroy protections by picking up blocks
# FIRE - fire can burn protections
# GHAST - ghasts can shoot exploding fireballs
# PISTON - pistons can remove the protection signs
# SAPLING - saplings can grow trees, destroying protection signs
# TNT - TNT can destroy protections by exploding
# ZOMBIE - zombies can destroy protected doors
# UNKNOWN - special value for all other unrecognized attacks
allowDestroyBy: []
